# Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

## Description
This repository contains the solution for Task 6 which involves analyzing monthly revenue and order volume using SQL aggregations on sales data.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: Sample - Superstore  
- Table: `Sample - Superstore`  
- Key columns:  
  - `Order Date` (date of the order)  
  - `Sales` (amount of the sale)  
  - `Order ID` (unique identifier for each order)

## Objective
- Extract year and month from the order date.  
- Calculate total revenue per month and year.  
- Count the distinct number of orders per month and year.  
- Group data by year and month.  
- Sort the results chronologically.

## SQL Script
The main SQL script (`sales_trend_analysis.sql`) includes:  
- Conversion of the order date from string to date format.  
- Cleaning the sales data to remove currency symbols and spaces.  
- Aggregation functions SUM() and COUNT(DISTINCT).  
- Filtering data for specific time periods using WHERE clause.

## How to Use
1. Load the `Sample - Superstore` dataset into your SQL environment.  
2. Run the `sales_trend_analysis.sql` script.  
3. Review the output table showing monthly total revenue and order counts.

## Results
- The `results.csv` file contains the output of the query for the years 2015 and 2016.
